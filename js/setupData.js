What a sight we had as we flew over the island and got our first glimpse of the beaches and the mountains - lush greenery rolling down the hills to meet with the long sandy beaches and glistening blue sea. The tiredness from the travelling faded away instantly as the excitement took over once again but this time with the realisation of actually being in Maui after all this time. ~ ~And then we arrived at the Grand Wailea. WOW! ~ ~Without a doubt this resort is amazing. From the lei greeting we got on arrival, to the beautiful room and the fantastic view of the ocean over the rolling lawns and pools. Im so pleased my husband and I came out a few days early to spend more time soaking up the Hawaiian sunshine and enjoy everything the Grand Wailea has to offer. Ive already bumped in to a few other colleagues who had the same idea down on the beach and you can only laugh when you bump into a colleague you havent seen in months while youre wearing a snorkel! ~ ~For those of you yet to leave home to fly to Maui, you are in for such a treat - and thats only from being in this resort, let alone when the actual Winners agenda starts. Today Im spending the day at the pool. No laptop, no to do list, no Filofax, no meetings. Just pure, uninterrupted relaxation. The only choice I have to make is which pool to lay my towel at! ~ ~Ill see you all here very soon. ~Aloha ~","","","N","1006","","","1006","2012-04-18 00:00:00","images/news/thumbs/22251_1.jpg","images/news/22251_1.jpg");');

","The Gartner Winners Circle invasion of the Grand Wailea Resort is now in full swing! ~ ~I picked up my welcome pack yesterday and met so many of the Events team whose names I have seen but whos faces were unfamiliar - its nice to finally meet those who have helped get us all here. Most of the Winners are now here and its been great meeting up with everyone after registering and exploring the Circle Lounge. Having never been to Winners Circle before I hadnt realized wed have such a nice Lounge area to use, and it was so handy being able to reprint my itinerary there after Id spoken to the tours and activities team to check a couple of details about my snorkel trip. Ill definitely be back here to spend my vouchers on more ice cream! ~ ~My husband and I also picked up our new Maui Jim sunglasses. Id not heard of this brand before but when I found out how popular this make was and saw the great styles and shapes they had I couldnt believe that we were each able to chose a pair as a welcome gift. Yet another great treat! ~ ~Today started in a similar fashion to the last few days, lounging around by the pool, although I did venture away from the adults pool onto the water slides with a few friends from the office. We had a lot of fun, got a soaking under the pool waterfall, and enjoyed a Mai Tai (or two) at the swim-up bar. We definitely have some funny stories to tell our colleagues back in the office! After lunch we ventured away from the resort and took a walk along the coastal path. We stopped at the telescope to look over at the island of Lanai and took in even more of the stunning surroundings. Another wow experience. ~ ~I saw all the Top Achievers leave for their lunch this morning and couldnt help feel a pang of jealousy when I heard they were heading by helicopter to the sprawling estate of a great local chef for what sounded like a dining extravaganza. Im sure theyll be making us even more envious when they return and tell us all about the trip and what they saw from the air. Something else to aim for next year! ~ ~Im looking forward to the welcome reception this evening and meeting up with rest of my team to toast our being in Maui. I had a lovely cocktail in the Botero Bar last night and the views from the balcony by the bar over the ocean are amazing, so Im sure it will be a great atmosphere tonight.

What an amazing choice of food - I didnt know where to begin at the buffet! Between my husband and I we pretty much sampled most of the food, but I did have to make sure I left enough room for a delicious cupcake (or two). I dont think anyone here will be in much danger of going hungry over the next few days! ~ ~Having gone to bed with a very satisfied belly, it was soon time to get up and head off to eat again, but this was definitely breakfast with a difference. Dining oceanside on the Molokini lawn just as the sun was starting to warm up the resort was a great experience. Once again, the food was delicious and the little decorative surfboards placed around the gardens really set the mood for the welcome presentation we were about to see from Laird Hamilton. ~ ~David Godfrey and Gene Hall opened the Welcome Presentation with a few laughs before all the Eagles were welcomed on stage to be recognized, which was another nice touch. Id had a quick look through the Laird Hamilton book we were given in our welcome bags, so had seen that he was known as the best big wave surfer in the world, but when David introduced Laird and he came on stage to a video showing him carving through the biggest waves I have ever seen, I saw why! ~ ~Lairds presentation was one of the most awe inspiring speeches Ive heard in a long time. His passion for surfing, respect for the ocean and determination to keep on pushing boundaries came through in everything he said. His drive, imagination and confidence that you can achieve anything you put your mind to seemed endless. Watching the videos of him ride these massive waves and talk so passionately about the freedom surfing offers and how its another form of artistic expression made me want to head straight to the beach after the presentation, surfboard under my arm, to experience it for myself. I may only have made it as far as the inflatable surfboard back down in the breakfast area today, but I have just booked my first ever surfing lesson for tomorrow and I cant wait to get out there to experience it for myself, even if I do spend the majority of the time falling into the water. ~ ~Tonight we have our team dinners which Im really looking forward to, and I think well all be heading to the Circle Club afterwards which should be fun.

The restaurant we went to was lovely and we had such a beautiful view from the terrace, followed by yet more delicious food. It was great to get the whole team together to celebrate our achievements from 2011 and to hear how the trip has been going for everyone so far. Its easy to forget the real reason were all here when laying by the pool, so its great to have these evening events to bring us all back together in celebration ~ ~After the dinner, I headed to the Circle Club back at the hotel and had such a fun evening dancing with my friends. The music in the club got us all moving and seeing everyone so relaxed and having fun letting their hair down was an excellent end to a brilliant day. ~ ~After such a busy evening and quite late night, I was very glad to be spending this morning relaxing in the spa. Before my massage I tried out all five of the different aromatic Terme Hydrotherapy Baths. They call this indulgent prelude to a treatment water therapy, and it really was a soothing and peaceful experience. I loved sitting under the waterfall and when the time came for my massage I almost had to be dragged out of the sauna! My sadness at leaving the Terme Baths area was soon forgotten as the full body massage was just pure heaven. I dont know if Ive ever felt more relaxed and the beautifully scented Hawaiian Lomi Lomi treatment did wonders for my tired arms and shoulders after all the paddling I did yesterday during my surfing lesson. ~ ~And in case you were wondering how my surfing lesson went yesterday. I spent far too much time falling off the board, but I did manage to stand up for a few seconds and ride a wave and I loved every second of it. Tomorrow were going on the zip line tour, which Im sure will get the adrenaline pumping again. Ive heard so many good things about this trip so I cant wait to try it out. ~ ~Im really looking forward to the motorcycle mania night tonight and cant wait to see what the Globe of Death is actually all about.

My husband and I had seen some of the set up for the Motorcycle Mania theme event earlier in the day so we couldnt wait to get down to have a proper look at everything once it had opened. Although we had a couple of biker accessories of our own, we had to add to our outfits from the goodies the Events team had got for us. I never thought Id be seen wearing a studded collar at a corporate event, but hey, the fun on a night like this is all in the participation. We got our spray on tattoos and wandered around looking at all the different motorcycles and getting our photos taken sitting on one of the Harleys. The noise bouncing around the reflecting pool when the bikes all started revving up was incredible and it was so much fun talking to some of the bikers and hearing some of their cool stories. We walked around all the buffet stations, and in what seems to have become the theme of the week, ate far more than we should have but with celebrity chefs from around the world preparing it, it would have been a crime not to. With the different food available at each station we enjoyed such delicious creations before heading down to the front of the lawn to watch the Globe of Death spectacle. Watching the two motorcyclists zooming around the inside of this circular cage inches away from each other was unbelievable. As they past each other time and again, seemingly getting faster and closer and covering almost all parts of the globe you really got a measure of the fearlessness of the drivers - another seriously wow moment! ~ ~After the final Globe of Death, we headed over to get ready for the band to play. Before the band started up, we had another great treat with some Hawaiian fire dancers performing with batons flaming at both ends. We all stood back to take in this amazing spectacle and admire the skill - and bravery - of these dancers, as some of those flames seemed to be very close to their skin! The band, Maggie Speaks, had performed two years ago at Winners Circle in the Bahamas, and once they started their set I could see straight away why they had been asked to come back. They were brilliant! Everyone on the lawn was rocking out and singing along to the covers the band sang and there was some serious air guitar being played to the great mix of songs. Im sure there are a few people whose voices may be a little gravelly today after all the singing but it was such a great atmosphere and having our own personal outdoor rock concert was truly amazing. The fireworks finale from the sea was spectacular. Perfectly timed and seamlessly accompanied by music from the band the fireworks were launched from a boat out in the bay in front of the hotel and were some of the best Ive ever seen. There were plenty of oohhs and aahhs from the crowd and it was an amazing ending to an amazing night. Mahalo to everyone who put on this incredible night for us! ~ ~Although last night was a late one, I didnt let my tiredness spoil my tour this morning and whizzing through the tree tops was exactly what I needed to clear out any cobwebs. Id been looking forward to the zip line tour all week and it did not disappoint. I was a bit nervous walking through the trees to have my turn on the first zip line, but the second I was clipped in and attached to the line I got a huge adrenalin rush. As I clung on to the harness and felt my feet leave the ground I tried to remember to take in the scenery, but that first ride was a little too exciting to focus on anything other than the fact I was dangling around in the air! I had assumed the zip lines would all be very fast, so it was a pleasant surprise to do a slower zip line with a couple of dips over the trees as I was able to take in the beautiful valleys below. Theres something pretty amazing about floating around high in the air with such fantastic panoramic views. The final longer zip line had us whizzing in past the waiting group so there were plenty of photo opportunities as we glided back and forth a little, before our ankles were grabbed for the last time and we were helped down from the zip line. Finishing the trip with eating lunch at the edge of a 1000-foot overlook was incredible. What a trip! ~ ~Now its time to get ready for the gala dinner. Ive heard that the dinner is always a great end to the event and am looking forward to getting dressed up after a week of wearing shorts and tshirts, although it will be pretty strange to be wearing proper shoes again as Ive got used to life in flip flops now! ~ ~","","","N","1006","","","1006","2012-04-22 00:00:00","images/news/thumbs/22255_1.jpg","images/news/22255_1.jpg");');

The Gala Dinner was phenomenal, the perfect way to mark the end of the event. We arrived for the champagne reception and had a lovely photo taken by the professional photographers, before also having a couple of team ones taken. Everyone had made such an effort with their outfits which was lovely to see, and the photos were another great memento to take away from Winners Circle. The Ballroom had been transformed since we were last in there for the Kick-off Presentation on Thursday and every small detail had been taken care of to make sure we had a special evening. The applause following David Godfreys introduction of each team of Winners and of the individual Top Achievers, was fantastic, and the video messages played for each Top Achiever was such a nice touch. Its good for all of us to get that little insight into the things that drive those who are leading the way, and it was a lovely way to also recognize the support we all get from our families. ~ ~The food was delicious, yet again, and once the dinner was over and the live band started playing the dance floor filled up straight away. Zippers, the band, were great and there were some serious dance moves being showcased, in some cases by entire teams! It was a fantastic night and a great ending to what has been an amazing few days here at Winners Circle. ~ ~Theres no way Im going to miss out on Miami next year! ~","","","N","1006","","","1006","2012-04-22 00:00:00","images/news/thumbs/22256_1.jpg","images/news/22256_1.jpg");');
